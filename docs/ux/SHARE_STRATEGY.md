# Shareability & Watermarking Strategy

**Role:** UX/Security Hybrid Designer
**Objective:** Ensure that when a screenshot leaves the platform, it carries the context required to prevent misinformation. A cropped screenshot must never look like a final "verdict" without its timestamp and methodology version.

## 1. The "Screenshot-Safe" Layout

### Problem
Users often crop headers and footers to isolate a specific score, stripping away the "Low Confidence" warnings or the scan date.

### Solution: The Holographic Repeater Pattern
Instead of a single footer, we embed context *inside* the data visualization components themselves.

1.  **Repeated Watermark:** The background of the report will feature a subtle, tiled pattern of the SponsorScope logo + "Generated [Date]".
2.  **Embedded Metadata:** Every `EvidenceCard` and `UncertaintyBand` container will have a micro-footer: `v2.4 | [Date] | ±2.4% Conf`.

## 2. Watermark Specification

### A. The "Ghost" Background
*   **Opacity:** 3% (Subtle, barely visible on screen, but clearly visible if contrast is boosted).
*   **Pattern:** Diagonal repeating text: `SponsorScope.ai • [Handle] • [Date]`.
*   **CSS:** `background-image: repeating-linear-gradient(...)`.

### B. The "Anchor" Strip
A persistent, sticky footer (or header in export mode) that contains:
*   Scan ID (UUID)
*   Methodology Version (e.g., v2.3)
*   "Not a legal judgment" disclaimer.

## 3. Share View Implementation

We will add a "Share Mode" toggle that:
1.  Expands all "Why?" sections (so the screenshot captures the reasoning).
2.  Injects the "Ghost" background.
3.  Highlights the Epistemic Uncertainty banner.

## 4. Visual Specs

| Component | Content | Style |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Card Micro-Footer** | `SponsorScope v2.3 • 2026-01-16` | `text-[8px] text-slate-700 font-mono text-right mt-2` |
| **Ghost Tile** | `[Handle] • [Date]` | `opacity-5 rotate-45` |
| **Export Footer** | "Generated by SponsorScope.ai. Confidence: Low." | `bg-black text-white p-2 text-xs` |

**Next Steps:** Update `ReportView` to include the Ghost Background and Card Micro-Footers.
