# Media & Citation Guidelines

**For Journalists, Researchers, and Content Creators**

SponsorScope.ai welcomes the use of our data for investigative reporting and market research, provided it is cited accurately and responsibly.

## ✅ How to Cite Us
*   "SponsorScope.ai estimates that..."
*   "According to probabilistic analysis by SponsorScope..."
*   "SponsorScope signals suggest a high concentration of coordinated activity..."

## ❌ How NOT to Cite Us
*   "SponsorScope proved that [Influencer] is a fraud." (We do not prove intent.)
*   "SponsorScope exposed [Influencer]'s fake followers." (We do not use the term "fake followers".)
*   "[Influencer] has a failing grade." (We provide signals, not school grades.)

## Required Attribution
Any visual use of our reports must include the **Confidence Interval** (e.g., "74 ± 9") and the **Methodology Version**.

## For Journalists
If you are writing a story about a specific creator based on our data, we strongly recommend:
1.  **Check the Data Completeness flag.** If it says "Partial Data", your story may be factually incorrect.
2.  **Contact the Creator.** Provide them a chance to explain anomalies (e.g., a giveaway or viral event).
3.  **Use the "Share" link**, not just a screenshot, so readers can see the live, updated data.
