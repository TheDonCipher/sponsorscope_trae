# Terms of Research & Service

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-16

## 1. Nature of the Service
SponsorScope.ai ("the Service") provides **probabilistic research estimates** based on publicly available data. The signals, metrics, and indices generated by the Service (collectively, "Research Data") are statistical approximations of audience behavior patterns.

## 2. No Factual Determinations
The Research Data:
*   **IS NOT** a factual finding regarding any individual's character, intent, or business practices.
*   **IS NOT** a legal judgment of fraud, deception, or contract breach.
*   **DOES NOT** constitute financial, legal, or reputational advice.

Users acknowledge that algorithmic analysis is inherently subject to limitations, including but not limited to: incomplete data, platform API restrictions, and the inability to distinguish between sophisticated automation and organic behavior with 100% certainty.

## 3. Prohibited Uses
You may **NOT** use the Service to:
1.  **Harass, defame, or "call out" individuals.**
2.  **Deny services or payments** based *solely* on automated signals without human review.
3.  **Assert as fact** that an account uses "bots", "fake followers", or "fraud".

## 4. Limitation of Liability
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, SPONSORSCOPE.AI DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY FOR ANY DECISIONS MADE OR ACTIONS TAKEN IN RELIANCE ON THE RESEARCH DATA. YOU ASSUME FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR INTERPRETATION OF THE DATA.

## 5. Correction Pathway
We provide a formal mechanism for subjects of analysis to dispute data completeness or report technical errors. We are committed to correcting proven inaccuracies in the underlying data (e.g., missing comments due to platform blocks) but do not negotiate the algorithmic methodology itself.
