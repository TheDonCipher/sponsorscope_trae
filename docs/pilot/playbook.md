# Pilot Launch Playbook: "Operation Botswana"

**Target Region:** Botswana
**Duration:** 30 Days
**Access Level:** Invite-Only (Waitlist)
**Status:** DRAFT

## 1. Objectives
*   **Contain Blast Radius**: Test in a smaller, culturally specific market before global release.
*   **Validate LLM nuance**: Can the system understand Setswana/English code-switching and local slang?
*   **Legal Stress Test**: Observe local influencer reaction without global media spotlight.

## 2. Participant Selection (N=50)
*   **Group A (Journalists)**: 10 vetted tech/business reporters.
*   **Group B (Agencies)**: 20 marketing professionals.
*   **Group C (Influencers)**: 20 volunteers (Beta testers) who agree to be scanned.

## 3. Rollout Schedule

| Day | Event | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Day 1** | **Soft Launch** | Access granted to Group C (Influencers). They scan themselves. |
| **Day 7** | **Feedback Review** | Analyze correction requests. Tune LLM for local slang. |
| **Day 14** | **Agency Access** | Access granted to Group B. Observe how they interpret "Signals". |
| **Day 21** | **Journalist Access** | Access granted to Group A. Monitor draft articles for accuracy. |
| **Day 30** | **Go/No-Go** | Decide on public release based on metrics. |

## 4. Success Metrics
*   **Correction Rate**: < 5% of reports disputed.
*   **Rescan Satisfaction**: > 80% of rescans accepted as "better".
*   **Misinterpretation**: 0 incidents of "Fake Follower" accusations in press.

## 5. Risk Mitigation
*   **Local Slang**: Pre-prompt Gemini with Botswana slang dictionary (e.g., "Sharp", "Eita").
*   **Opt-Out**: Any influencer can request permanent blacklist during pilot.
