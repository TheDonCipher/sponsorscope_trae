# Internal Ethical Review Record

**Date:** 2026-01-16
**Reviewer:** SponsorScope Ethics Committee (Autonomous)
**Status:** SEALED

## 1. Explicit Non-Goals
*   We DO NOT aim to "clean up" social media.
*   We DO NOT aim to be the "internet police".
*   We DO NOT aim to destroy careers.

Our ONLY goal is to provide **transparency into public data metrics** to enable informed business decisions.

## 2. Accepted Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **False Positives (Organic Virality)** | Graph Layer detects "reuse" vs "one-off" virality. Confidence intervals widen. | **Managed** |
| **Reputational Harm** | Banned words list ("Fraud", "Fake"). "Signal" renaming. | **Managed** |
| **Algorithmic Bias** | LLM Refinement specifically prompted for cultural slang/nuance. | **Monitored** |
| **Weaponization by Rivals** | "Comparison" features disabled for Partial Data. | **Hardened** |

## 3. Known Limitations (Publicly Acknowledged)
*   **The "Smart Bot" Gap**: LLMs are getting better at mimicking humans. We acknowledge we cannot catch state-of-the-art text generation yet.
*   **The Private/Public Gap**: We only see what is public. DMs are a black box.

## 4. Pre-Launch Checklist
*   [x] Methodology Published
*   [x] Legal Disclaimers Drafted
*   [x] Correction Workflow Active
*   [x] "Score" renamed to "Signal Strength"
*   [x] Confidence Intervals Visualized

**VERDICT:** The system meets the ethical baseline for public release.
