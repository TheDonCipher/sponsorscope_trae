# SponsorScope.ai - Adversarial Threat Model & Stress Test Report

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2026-01-16
**Status:** INTERNAL - CONFIDENTIAL
**Auditor:** SponsorScope Autonomous Red Team

## 1. Executive Summary

This report simulates hostile conditions to stress-test the epistemic integrity of SponsorScope.ai. Our primary goal is to determine if the system fails safely and transparently when subjected to manipulation, partial data, or adversarial interpretation.

**Verdict:** **CONDITIONAL GO**. The system is robust against crude manipulation but requires specific UI and documentation safeguards before public release to mitigate "Authority Bias" risks.

## 2. Threat Model Matrix

| Threat ID | Attack Vector | Likelihood | Impact | Detection | Mitigation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **T-01** | **Engagement Pods** (Coordinated reciprocal comments) | High | False "High Engagement" Score | Hard. Entropy may look normal if users write unique comments. | **Reciprocal Graph Analysis** (Phase 3). For MVP: Heuristic penalizes "low variance" timing if pod drops comments simultaneously. |
| **T-02** | **"Nice Pic" Botnet** (Low effort bots) | High | False Authenticity Score | **High**. Entropy heuristic effectively penalizes short, repetitive text. | **Heuristic Floor**. The current "Bot Probability Floor" correctly caps this score. |
| **T-03** | **Data Blockade** (User blocks comments during scan) | Medium | False "Clean" Report (Missing toxicity) | **High**. Scraper detects block. | **Degradation Flags**. `PARTIAL_NO_COMMENTS` flag MUST be prominent. Confidence score penalties (0.7x) implemented. |
| **T-04** | **Sarcasm / Cultural Slang** | Medium | False "Unsafe" Brand Grade | Medium. LLM may misinterpret. | **LLM Refinement**. Gemini prompted for "context-aware relevance". Manual correction log (Governance). |
| **T-05** | **Authority Bias** (Media cites score as absolute truth) | High | Reputational Harm to Influencer | N/A (Social) | **UI Design**. Confidence intervals must be visualized *before* the score. "Partial Data" banners must be non-dismissible. |

## 3. Stress Test Scenarios & Results

### Scenario A: The "Engagement Pod" Attack
**Setup**: 20 users comment within 60 seconds on a post. Comments are unique ("Great shot!", "Loving this vibe", "So cool").
*   **Heuristic Response**:
    *   *Entropy*: High (Pass).
    *   *Uniqueness*: High (Pass).
    *   *Timing Variance*: **FAIL** (Too concentrated).
*   **Result**: The `timing_variance` heuristic correctly flags this as suspicious, raising the Bot Probability Floor.
*   **LLM Refinement**: Gemini sees unique text but is **capped** by the Bot Floor (>0.8). It cannot raise the score.
*   **Outcome**: **SAFE**. System correctly identifies unnatural velocity.

### Scenario B: The "Locked Down" Influencer
**Setup**: Influencer turns off comments to hide toxicity. Scraper retrieves posts but 0 comments.
*   **System Response**:
    *   `DataCompleteness` -> `PARTIAL_NO_COMMENTS`.
    *   `TrueEngagement` -> Calculated based on Likes only (Counts available on Post object).
    *   `AudienceAuthenticity` -> **N/A** (Fallback score 50.0, Confidence 0.1).
*   **Outcome**: **SAFE**, provided the UI screams "INCOMPLETE DATA". If UI hides this, it is **UNSAFE**.

### Scenario C: The "Smart Bot" (LLM-Generated Comments)
**Setup**: Bots post long, context-relevant comments generated by ChatGPT.
*   **Heuristic Response**:
    *   *Entropy*: High (Pass).
    *   *Uniqueness*: High (Pass).
    *   *Timing*: Randomized (Pass).
*   **Result**: Heuristics fail to detect.
*   **LLM Refinement**: Gemini *might* detect "generic AI tone" but is not guaranteed.
*   **Outcome**: **VULNERABLE**. This is a known limitation of current GenAI detection.
*   **Mitigation**: Accept this risk for MVP. Rely on "Niche Credibility" (Phase 2) to check if commenters follow similar niche accounts.

## 4. Recommended Safeguards (Pre-Launch)

### 4.1. Scoring Logic Updates
*   [x] **Enforce Confidence Cap**: Ensure `PARTIAL_NO_COMMENTS` caps max confidence at 0.7 (Implemented in `calibration.py`).
*   [ ] **Burst Penalty**: Tune `timing_variance` threshold. Current 3600s might be too loose. Recommend tightening to 300s (5 mins) for "suspicious burst" detection.

### 4.2. UI/UX Requirements
*   **Visual Uncertainty**: Do not render `84/100`. Render `84 ± 6` or a gradient bar.
*   **"Partial Data" Warning**: If `data_completeness != FULL`, the report header must be yellow/orange.
*   **Evidence Links**: Every "Risk Flag" must be clickable to show the raw comment/post that triggered it.

### 4.3. Policy & Governance
*   **Disclaimer**: "Scores are probabilistic estimates, not judicial verdicts."
*   **Correction Mechanism**: Must have a "Report Error" button for influencers to dispute "Partial Data" claims (e.g., "I unblocked comments, rescan me").

## 5. Go / No-Go Recommendation

**conditional GO.**

The backend architecture is sound and "fail-safe". The primary risks are now **Frontend/Interpretation** risks.

**Crucial Fix before Public Link:**
Ensure the Frontend strictly adheres to the `warning_banners` contract. If the API returns a banner, it **must** be rendered.
