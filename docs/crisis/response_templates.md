# Response Templates: Influencer Backlash

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-16

## Scenario 1: "SponsorScope is calling me a fraud!"
**Context**: Influencer tweets screenshot of "Low Signal" score, claiming defamation.
**Response (Twitter/X)**:
> "Hi [Handle], we want to clarify: A low 'Signal Strength' is NOT an accusation of fraud. It simply means our system detected statistical patterns that differ from the average organic profile (e.g., timing bursts or repeated comment clusters).
>
> If you believe this is due to incomplete data (e.g., blocked comments), please use the 'Report Issue' button on your page to trigger a free rescan. We are committed to data accuracy."

## Scenario 2: "They are scraping my private data!"
**Context**: Influencer claims we hacked their DMs or private stories.
**Response (Official Statement)**:
> "SponsorScope.ai strictly analyzes **publicly available data only**. We do not, and cannot, access private DMs, archived stories, or non-public insights. Our analysis is based solely on what is visible to any public visitor on the platform."

## Scenario 3: "Their AI doesn't understand my culture/slang."
**Context**: Influencer claims low authenticity score because they use local slang.
**Response (Direct Message / Email)**:
> "Thank you for flagging this. Our system is trained to recognize diverse linguistic patterns, but it is not perfect. We have flagged your report for review by our engineering team to improve our dialect recognition models. In the meantime, we have added a note to your report context."
