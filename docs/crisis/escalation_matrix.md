## Silence vs. Response Decision Tree

1.  **Is the claim factually true?**
    *   YES -> Acknowledge and fix (e.g., "Yes, we missed comments from Tuesday").
    *   NO -> Go to 2.

2.  **Is the claim legally dangerous (Defamation/Harassment)?**
    *   YES -> **SILENCE**. Refer to Legal.
    *   NO -> Go to 3.

3.  **Is the claim gaining viral traction?**
    *   YES -> Post "Clarification" (not apology) linking to Methodology.
    *   NO -> Ignore. Do not feed the trolls.
