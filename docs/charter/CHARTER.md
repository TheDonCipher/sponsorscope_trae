# The SponsorScope Charter

**Version 1.0** | **Date:** 2026-01-16

## Why We Exist

The creator economy is a $250 billion industry built on trust, yet it lacks the basic auditing infrastructure of traditional finance. SponsorScope.ai exists to provide **neutral, probabilistic transparency** into public social media data.

We believe that:
1.  **Transparency fosters trust.** Sponsors invest more when they can verify reach.
2.  **Creators deserve defense.** Legitimate creators are often unfairly accused of "fake followers" due to viral spikes or algorithm changes. Data defends them.
3.  **The future is verified.** As AI-generated content floods the web, distinguishing human engagement from automated patterns is a critical utility.

## What We Measure
We measure **Signal Consistency**.
*   Does the engagement volume match the follower count?
*   Do the comments show the linguistic entropy (variety) expected of a human crowd?
*   Do the timestamps follow organic circadian rhythms or machine-precise bursts?

## What We Do NOT Measure
*   **Intent**: We cannot know *why* a bot is commenting. It could be the creator, a rival trying to frame them, or a random spam wave. We flag the *pattern*, not the *perpetrator*.
*   **Character**: A low signal score is not a moral judgment. It is a data anomaly.
*   **Private Data**: We respect privacy. We never hack, scrape private pages, or dox.
